This is an attempt to identify pulsation modes in white dwarfs using publicly available light curve data, focusing on asteroseismology of hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating WDs (ZZ Cetis). Starting with time-series photometry from the TESS mission, I extract pulsation frequencies using Fourier analysis and identify true modes by filtering out combination frequencies and noise, following techniques similar to those presented by Celeste Marie Yeates in 'Mode Identification from Combination Frequency Amplitudes in Pulsating White Dwarf Stars'. We also explore model-based fitting techniques including Bayesian inference to refine our mode identifications. Through this project, we aim to demonstrate a practical approach to solving the mode identification problem which is a key step in probing the internal structure of white dwarfs.
